Overview
The Problem

Access to affordable healthcare is a significant issue in Hawaii. Uninsured or underinsured individuals often struggle to find information about healthcare services that they can afford, leading to delayed or no care.

It aggregates and simplifies information about various healthcare services, providing an easy-to-navigate platform that points users to the most relevant and cost-effective healthcare solutions.

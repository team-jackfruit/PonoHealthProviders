*A web application designed to guide uninsured and underinsured individuals in Hawaii to various healthcare options. It aggregates and simplifies information about various healthcare services, providing an easy-to-navigate platform that points users to the most relevant and cost-effective healthcare solutions.*

## The Problem

Access to affordable healthcare is a significant issue in Hawaii. Uninsured or underinsured individuals often struggle to find information about healthcare services that they can afford, leading to delayed or no care.

## Overview

*Approach*: *The web application will operate without storing personal user data, ensuring privacy and compliance with regulations. The application will feature:*

* **User Profiles**: Users can indicate their insurance status (insured, uninsured, or underinsured) and their healthcare needs.

* **Directory**: A comprehensive listing of healthcare facilities, services offered, and costs, filterable by various criteria.

* **Resources**: Links to government and non-profit resources for healthcare, as well as links to other healthcare-related websites.
